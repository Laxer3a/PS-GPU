The GPU can render Polygons, Lines, or Rectangles to the Drawing Buffer, and
sends the Display Buffer to the Television Set. Polygons are useful for 3D
graphics (or rotated/scaled 2D graphics), Rectangles are useful for 2D graphics
and Text output.<br>

<br>
<b>GPU Command Summary</b><br>
Commands/Packets consist of a 8bit command number (MSBs) and a 24bit parameter
(LSBs), which are written as 32bit value to GP0 or GP1.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  GP0(00h)                 - Nop?
  GP0(01h,02h,80h,A0h,C0h) - Direct VRAM Access
  GP0(03h)                 - Unknown (does take up FIFO space!!!)
  GP0(1Fh)                 - Interrupt Request (IRQ1)
  GP0(20h..3Fh)            - Render Polygons
  GP0(40h..5Fh)            - Render Lines
  GP0(60h..7Fh)            - Render Rectangles
  GP0(E1h..E6h)            - Rendering Attributes
  GP1(00h..09h,10h,20h)    - Display Control (these via GP1 register)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Some GP0 commands require additional parameters, which are written (following
to the command) as further 32bit values to GP0. The execution of the command
starts when all parameters have been received (or, in case of Polygon/Line
commands, when the first 3/2 vertices have been received).<br>
<br>
<b>VRAM Overview / VRAM Addressing</b><br>
VRAM is 1MByte (not mapped to the CPU bus) (it can be read/written only via I/O
or DMA). The memory is used for:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Framebuffer(s)      ;Usually 2 buffers (Drawing Area, and Display Area)
  Texture Page(s)     ;Required when using Textures
  Texture Palette(s)  ;Required when using 4bit/8bit Textures
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
The 1MByte VRAM is organized as 512 lines of 2048 bytes. It is accessed via
coordinates, ranging from (0,0)=Upper-Left to (N,511)=Lower-Right.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Unit  = 4bit  8bit  16bit  24bit   Halfwords   | Unit   = Lines
  Width = 4096  2048  1024   682.66  1024        | Height = 512
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
The horizontal coordinates are addressing memory in
4bit/8bit/16bit/24bit/halfword units (depending on what data formats you are
using) (or a mixup thereof, eg. a halfword-base address, plus a 4bit texture
coordinate).<br>

<b>GP0(35h,37h,3Dh,3Fh) - Undocumented/Nonsense (Raw Texture + UNUSED shading)</b><br>
These are undocumented inefficient nonsense commands: Parameters are same as
for GP0(34h,36h,3Ch,3Eh), ie. with colors for all vertices, but without
actually using that colors. Instead, the commands are rendering raw textures
without blending.<br>
In other words, the commands have same function as GP0(25h,27h,2Dh,2Fh), but
with additional/unused parameters (and possible additional/unused internal
gouraud shading calculations).<br>
For whatever reason, Castlevania is actually using these nonsense commands,
namely GP0(3Dh) and GP0(3Fh).<br>
<br>
<b>GP0(21h,23h,29h,2Bh,31h,33h,39h,3Bh) - Undocumented/Nonsense</b><br>
These commands have texture-blending disabled, which is nonsense because they
are using untextured polygons anyways, ie. they are probably same as
GP0(20h,22h,28h,2Ah,30h,32h,38h,3Ah).<br>
<br>
<b>Notes</b><br>
Polygons are displayed up to &lt;excluding&gt; their lower-right coordinates.<br>
Four-point polygons are internally processed as two Three-point polygons, the
first consisting of Vertices 1,2,3, and the second of  Vertices 2,3,4.<br>
Within the Three-point polygons, the ordering of the vertices is don't care at
the GPU side (a front-back check, based on clockwise or anti-clockwise
ordering, can be implemented at the GTE side).<br>
Dither enable (in Texpage command) affects ONLY polygons that do use Gouraud
Shading or Texture Blending.<br>

<b>Note</b><br>
Lines are displayed up to &lt;including&gt; their lower-right coordinates (ie.
unlike as for polygons, the lower-right coordinate is not excluded).<br>
If dithering is enabled (via Texpage command), then both monochrome and shaded
lines are drawn with dithering (this differs from monochrome polygons and
monochrome rectangles).<br>
<br>
<b>Termination Codes for Poly-Lines (aka Linestrips)</b><br>
The termination code should be usually 55555555h, however, Wild Arms 2 uses
50005000h (unknown which exact bits/values are relevant there).<br>
<br>
<b>Wire-Frame</b><br>
Poly-Lines can be used (among others) to create Wire-Frame polygons (by setting
the last Vertex equal to Vertex 1).<br>

Rectangles are drawn much faster than polygons. Unlike for polygons, gouroud
shading is not possible, dithering isn't applied, the rectangle must forcefully
have horizontal and vertical edges, textures cannot be rotated or scaled, and,
of course, the GPU does render Rectangles at once (without splitting them into
triangles).<br>

Unlike for Textured-Polygons, the "Texpage" must be set up separately for
Rectangles, via GP0(E1h). Width and Height can be up to 1023x511, however, the
maximum size of the texture window is 256x256 (so the source data will be
repeated when trying to use sizes larger than 256x256).<br>
<br>
<b>Texture Origin and X/Y-Flip</b><br>
Vertex &amp; Texcoord specify the upper-left edge of the rectangle. And,
normally, screen coords and texture coords are both incremented during
rendering the rectangle pixels.<br>
Optionally, X/Y-Flip bits can be set in Texpage.Bit12/13, these bits cause the
texture coordinates to be decremented (instead of incremented). The X/Y-Flip
bits do affect only Rectangles (not Polygons, nor VRAM Transfers).<br>
Caution: Reportedly, the X/Y-Flip feature isn't supported on old PSX consoles
(unknown which ones exactly, maybe such with PU-7 mainboards, and unknown how
to detect flipping support; except of course by reading VRAM).<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
There are also two VRAM Transfer commands which work similar to GP0(60h) and
GP0(65h). Eventually, that commands might be even faster... although not sure
if they do use the Texture Cache?<br>
The difference is that VRAM Transfers do not clip to the Drawig Area boundary,
do not support fully-transparent nor semi-transparent texture pixels, and do
not convert color depths (eg. without 4bit texture to 16bit framebuffer
conversion).<br>

Size Restriction: The maximum distance between two vertices is 1023
horizontally, and 511 vertically. Polygons and lines that are exceeding that
dimensions are NOT rendered. For example, a line from Y1=-300 to Y2=+300 is NOT
rendered, a line from Y1=-100 to Y2=+400 is rendered (as far as it is within
the drawing area).<br>
If portions of the polygon/line/rectangle are located outside of the drawing
area, then the hardware renders only the portion that is inside of the drawing
area. Not sure if the hardware is skipping all clipped pixels at once (within a
single clock cycle), or if it's (slowly) processing them pixel by pixel?<br>

However, for texture blending, 8bit values of 80h are brightest (values
81h..FFh are "brighter than bright" allowing to make textures about twice as

If you have configured the GTE to produce vertices with coordinate "0,0" being

When bit0 is off, the upper bit of the data written to the framebuffer is equal
to bit15 of the texture color (ie. it is set for colors that are marked as
"semi-transparent") (for untextured polygons, bit15 is set to zero).<br>
When bit1 is on, any (old) pixels in the framebuffer with bit15=1 are
write-protected, and cannot be overwritten by (new) rendering commands.<br>
The mask setting affects all rendering commands, as well as CPU-to-VRAM and
VRAM-to-VRAM transfer commands (where it acts on the separate halfwords, ie. as
for 15bit textures). However, Mask does NOT affect the Fill-VRAM command.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
GP0(E3h..E5h) do not take up space in the FIFO, so they are probably executed
immediately (even if there're still other commands in the FIFO). Best use them
only if you are sure that the FIFO is empty (otherwise the new Drawing Area
settings might accidently affect older Rendering Commands in the FIFO).<br>

<b>Notes</b><br>
The coordinates for the above VRAM transfer commands are absolute framebuffer
addresses (not relative to Draw Offset, and not clipped to Draw Area).<br>
Non-DMA transfers seem to be working at any time, but GPU-DMA Transfers seem to
be working ONLY during V-Blank (outside of V-Blank, portions of the data appear
to be skipped, and the following words arrive at wrong addresses), unknown if
it's possible to change that by whatever configuration settings...? That
problem appears ONLY for continous DMA aka VRAM transfers (linked-list DMA aka
Ordering Table works even outside V-Blank).<br>

Requests IRQ1. Can be acknowledged via GP1(02h). This feature is rarely used.<br>
Note: The command is used by Blaze'n'Blade, but the game doesn't have IRQ1

Unknown. Doesn't seem to be used by any games. Unlike the "NOP" commands,
GP0(03h) does take up space in FIFO, so it is apparently not a NOP.<br>

<b>GP0(00h) - NOP (?)</b><br>
This command doesn't take up space in the FIFO (eg. even if a VRAM-to-VRAM

command FIFO becoming full. So, either the command is ignored (or, if it has a
function, it is executed immediately, even while the transfer is busy).<br>

are same as GP0(00h), however, the Drawing Area/Offset commands GP0(E3h..E5h)

<b>Display start/end</b><br>
Specifies where the display area is positioned on the screen, and how much data

the horizontal/vertical start/end values are default. By changing these you can
get bigger/smaller display screens. On most TV's there is some black around the
edge, which can be utilised by setting the start of the screen earlier and the
end later. The size of the pixels is NOT changed with these settings, the GPU
simply sends more data to the screen. Some monitors/TVs have a smaller display
area and the extended size might not be visible on those sets. "(Mine is

Specifies the horizontal range within which the display area is displayed. For
resolutions other than 320 pixels it may be necessary to fine adjust the value
to obtain an exact match (eg. X2=X1+pixels*cycles_per_pix).<br>
The number of displayed pixels per line is "(((X2-X1)/cycles_per_pix)+2) AND
NOT 3" (ie. the hardware is rounding the width up/down to a multiple of 4
pixels).<br>
Most games are using a width equal to the horizontal resolution (ie. 256, 320,
368, 512, 640 pixels). A few games are using slightly smaller widths (probably
due to programming bugs). Pandemonium 2 is using a bigger "overscan" width
(ensuring an intact picture without borders even on mis-calibrated TV sets).<br>
The 260h value is the first visible pixel on normal TV Sets, this value is used

Specifies the vertical range within which the display area is displayed. The

to generate vblank interrupts (IRQ0).<br>

Note: Interlace must be enabled to see all lines in 480-lines mode (interlace
is causing ugly flickering, so a non-interlaced low resolution image is
typically having better quality than a high resolution interlaced image, a
pretty bad example are the intro screens shown by the BIOS). The Display Area
Color Depth does NOT affect the Drawing Area (the Drawing Area is
&lt;always&gt; 15bit).<br>
When the "Reverseflag" is set, the display scrolls down 2 lines or so, and
colored regions are getting somehow hatched/distorted, but black and white
regions are still looking okay. Don't know what that's good for? Probably
relates to PAL/NTSC-Color Clock vs PSX-Dot Clock mismatches: Bit7=0 causes

This feature seems to be intended for debugging purposes (most released games
do contain program code for disabling textures, but do never execute it).<br>
GP1(09h) seems to be supported only on New GPUs. Old GPUs don't support it all,
and there seem to be some Special/Prototype GPUs that use GP1(20h) instead of
GP1(09h).<br>

<b>Mis-Centered PAL Games (wrong GP1(06h)/GP1(07h) settings)</b><br>
NTSC games are typically well centered (using X1=260h, and Y1/Y2=88h+/-N).<br>
PAL games should be centered as X1=260h, and Y1/Y2=A3h+/-N) - these values
would be looking well on a Philips Philetta TV Set, and do also match up with
other common picture positions (eg. as used by Nintendo's SNES console).<br>
However, most PAL games are using completely different "random" centering
values (maybe caused by different developers trying to match the centering to
the different TV Sets) (although it looks more as if the PAL developers just
went amok: Many PAL games are even using different centerings for their Intro,
Movie, and actual Game sequences).<br>
In result, most PAL games are looking like crap when playing them on a real
PSX. For PSX emulators it may be recommended to ignore the GP1(06h)/GP1(07h)
centering, and instead, apply auto-centering to PAL games.<br>
For PAL game developers, it may be recommended to add a screen centering option
(as found in Tomb Raider 3, for example). Unknown if this is really required...
or if X1=260h, and Y1/Y2=A3h+/-N would work fine on most or all PAL TV Sets?<br>

Further GPU status information can be retrieved via GP1(10h) and GP0(C0h).<br>
<br>
<b>Ready Bits</b><br>
Bit28: Normally, this bit gets cleared when the command execution is busy (ie.
once when the command and all of its parameters are received), however, for
Polygon and Line Rendering commands, the bit gets cleared immediately after
receiving the command word (ie. before receiving the vertex parameters). The
bit is used as DMA request in DMA Mode 2, accordingly, the DMA would probably
hang if the Polygon/Line parameters are transferred in a separate DMA block
(ie. the DMA probably starts ONLY on command words).<br>
Bit27: Gets set after sending GP0(C0h) and its parameters, and stays set until
all data words are received; used as DMA request in DMA Mode 3.<br>
Bit26: Gets set when the GPU wants to receive a command. If the bit is cleared,
then the GPU does either want to receive data, or it is busy with a command
execution (and doesn't want to receive anything).<br>
Bit25: This is the DMA Request bit, however, the bit is also useful for non-DMA
transfers, especially in the FIFO State mode.<br>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<b>Shaded Textures</b><br>
The Old GPU crops 8:8:8 bit gouraud shading color to 5:5:5 bit before
multiplying it with the texture color, resulting in rather poor graphics. For
example, the snow scence in the first level of Tomb Raider I looks a lot
smoother on New GPUs.<br>
The cropped colors are looking a bit as if dithering would be disabled
(although, technically dithering works fine, but due to the crippled color
input, it's always using the same dither pattern per 8 intensities, instead of
using 8 different dither patterns).<br>
<br>
<b>Memory/Rendering Timings</b><br>
The Old GPU uses two Dual-ported VRAM chips (each with two 16bit databusses,
one for CPU/DMA/rendering access, and one for output to the video DAC). The New
GPU uses s normal DRAM chip (with single 32bit databus).<br>
The exact timing differences are unknown, but the different memory types should
result in quite different timings:<br>
The Old GPU might perform better on non-32bit aligned accesses, and on memory
accesses performed simultaneously with DAC output.<br>
On the other hand, the New GPU's DRAM seems to be faster in some cases (for
example, during Vblank, it's fast enough to perform DMA's with blksiz&gt;10h,
which exceeds the GPU's FIFO size, and causes lost data on Old GPUs).<br>
<br>
<b>X/Y-Flip and 2MB Video RAM</b><br>
The X/Y-flipping feature may be used by arcade games (provided that the arcade
board is fitted with New GPUs). The flipping feature does also work on retail
consoles with New GPUs, but PSX games should never use that feature (for
maintaining compatiblity with older PSX consoles).<br>
2Mbyte Video RAM is used on some arcade boards. Whilst PSX retail consoles are
always containing only 1MByte RAM, so the feature cannot be used even if the
console contains a New GPU. There's one special case: Some PSone consoles are
actually fitted with 2MB chips (maybe because smaller chips haven't been in
production anymore), but the chips are wired so that only half of the memory is
accessible (the extra memory could be theoretically unlocked with some minimal
hardware modification).<br>
<br>
<b>GPU Detection (and optional texture disable)</b><br>
Below is slightly customized GPU Detection function taken from Perfect Assassin
(the index7 latching works ONLY on New GPUs, whilst old GPUs would leave the
latched value unchanged; as a workaround, the index4 latching is used to ensure
that the latch won't contain 000002h on old GPUs, assuming that index4 is never
set to 000002h).<br>

<br>
<b>GP0(02h) FillVram</b><br>
The FillVram command does normally ignore the lower 4bit of the x-coordinate
(and software should always set those bits to zero). However, if the 4bits are
all set, then the Old GPU does write each 2nd pixel to wrong memory address.
For example, a 32x4 pixel fill produces following results for x=0..1Fh:<br>

<b>Arcade GPUs</b><br>
Some arcade boards are using normal retail GPUs, however, there are also two
special non-retail 208pin GPUs which seem to be solely used on arcade boards:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  IC21  - 208pin - "SONY CXD8538Q"   ;seen on GP-11 (namco System 11) boards
  IC103 - 208pin - "SONY CXD8654Q"   ;seen on GP-15 (namco System 12) boards
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
The exact differences to retail GPUs are unknown. One of the special GPUs is
said to use entierly different command numbers for rendering commands (maybe
some old prototype variant, or maybe some protection against cloning arcade
boards with retail chips).<br>
<br>
<br>

<!--------------------------------------->
<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td><font size="+2">
  <a name="gpudepthordering"></a>&nbsp;
  GPU Depth Ordering
</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<b>Absent Depth Buffer</b><br>
The PlayStation's GPU stores only RGB colors in the framebuffer (ie. unlike
modern 3D processors, it's NOT buffering Depth values; leaving apart the Mask
bit, which could be considered as a tiny 1bit "Depth" or "Priority" value). In
fact, the GPU supports only X,Y coordinates, and it's totally unaware of Z
coordinates. So, when rendering a polygon, the hardware CANNOT determine which
of the new pixels are in front/behind of the old pixels in the buffer.<br>
<br>
<b>Simple Ordering</b><br>
The rendering simply takes place in the ordering as the data is sent to the GPU
(ie. the most distant objects should be sent first). For 2D graphics, it's
fairly easy follow that order (eg. even multi-layer 2D graphics can be using
DMA2-continous mode).<br>
<br>
<b>Depth Ordering Table (OT)</b><br>
For 3D graphics, the ordering of the polygons may change more or less randomly
(eg. when rotating/moving the camera). To solve that problem, the whole
rendering data is usually first stored in a Depth Ordering Table (OT) in Main
RAM, and, once when all polygons have been stored in the OT, the OT is sent to
the GPU via "DMA2-linked-list" mode.<br>
<br>
<b>Initializing an empty OT (via DMA6)</b><br>
DMA channel 6 can be used to set up an empty linked list, in which each entry
points to the previous:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  DPCR    - enable bits                                 ;Example=x8xxxxxxh
  D6_MADR - pointer to the LAST table entry             ;Example=8012300Ch
  D6_BCR  - number of list entries                      ;Example=00000004h
  D6_CHCR - control bits (should be 11000002h)          ;Example=11000002h
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Each entry has a size of 00h words (upper 8bit), and a pointer to the previous
entry (lower 24bit). With the above Example values, the generated table would
look like so:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  [80123000h]=00FFFFFFh  ;1st entry, points to end code (xxFFFFFFh)
  [80123004h]=00123000h  ;2nd entry, points to 1st entry
  [80123008h]=00123004h  ;3rd entry, points to 2nd entry
  [8012300Ch]=00123008h  ;last entry, points to 3rd entry (table entrypoint)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<b>Inserting Entries (Passing GTE data to the OT) (by software)</b><br>
The GTE commands AVSZ3 and AVSZ4 can be used to calculate the Average Z
coordinates of a polygon (based on its three or four Z coordinates). The result
is returned as a 16bit Z value in GTE register OTZ, the commands do also allow
to divide the result, to make it less than 16bit (the full 16bit would require
an OT of 256KBytes - for the EMPTY table, which would be a waste of memory, and
which would slowdown the DMA2/DMA6 operations) (on the other hand, a smaller
table means less depth resolution).<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  [PacketAddr+0]      = [80123000h+OTZ*4] + (N SHL 24)   &lt;--internal link chain
  [PacketAddr+4..N*4] = GP0 Command(s) and Parameters    &lt;--data (send to GP0)
  [80123000h+OTZ*4]   = PacketAddr AND FFFFFFh           &lt;--internal link chain
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
If there's been already an entry (at the same OTZ index), then the new polygon
will be processed first (ie. it will appear "behind" of the old entry).<br>
Not sure if the packet size must be limited to max N=16 words (ie. as for the

<b>Framebuffer</b><br>

Note: In most cases, you'll need TWO framebuffers (one being displayed, and
used as rendering target) (unless you are able to draw the whole new image
during vblank, or unless when using single-layer 2D graphics). So, resolutions
that occupy more than 512K would exceed the available 1MB VRAM when using 2
buffers. Also, high resolutions mean higher rendering load, and less texture
memory.<br>

Note: The 24bit pixels occupy 3 bytes (not 4 bytes with unused MSBs), so each 6
bytes contain two 24bit pixels. The 24bit display mode works only with VRAM
transfer commands like GP0(A0h); the rendering commands GP0(20h..7Fh) cannot
output 24bit data. Ie. 24bit mode is used mostly for MDEC videos (and some 2D

<b>Texture Bitmaps</b><br>
A texture is an image put on a polygon or sprite. The data of a texture can be

A Texture Page is a 256x256 texel region in VRAM (the Polygon rendering
commands are using Texcoords with 8bit X,Y coordinates, so polygons cannot use
textures bigger than 256x256) (the Rectangle rendering commands with
width/height parameters could theoretically use larger textures, but the
hardware clips their texture coordinates to 8bit, too).<br>
The GP0(E2h) Texture Window (aka Texture Repeat) command can be used to reduce
the texture size to less than 256x256 texels.<br>
The Texture Pages can be located in the frame buffer on X multiples of 64
halfwords and Y multiples of 256 lines.<br>
<br>
<b>Texture Palettes - CLUT (Color Lookup Table)</b><br>
The clut is a the table where the colors are stored for the image data in the
CLUT modes. The pixels of those images are used as indexes to this table. The
clut is arranged in the frame buffer as a 256x1 image for the 8bit clut mode,
and a 16x1 image for the 4bit clut mode.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  0-4   Red       (0..31)         ;\Color 0000h        = Fully-Transparent

The clut data can be arranged in the frame buffer at X multiples of 16
(X=0,16,32,48,etc) and anywhere in the Y range of 0-511.<br>
<br>
<b>Texture Color Black Limitations</b><br>
On the PSX, texture color 0000h is fully-transparent, that means textures
cannot contain Black pixels. However, in some cases, Color 8000h (Black with
semi-transparent flag) can be used, depending on the rendering command:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  opaque command, eg. GP0(24h)      --&gt; 8000h = Non-Transparent Black
  semi-transp command, eg. GP0(26h) --&gt; 8000h = Semi-Transparent Black
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
So, with semi-transparent rendering commands, it isn't possible to use
Non-Transparent Black pixels in textures, the only workaround is to use colors
like 0001h (dark red) or 0400h (dark blue). However, due to the PSX's rather
steeply increasing intensity ramp, these colors are clearly visible to be
brighter than black.<br>
<br>
<b>RGB Intensity Notes</b><br>
The Playstations RGB values aren't linear to normal RGB values (as used on
PCs). The min/max values are of course the same, but the medium values differ:<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  Intensity        PC      PSX
  Minimum          0       0
  Medium (circa)   16      8
  Maximum          31      31
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
Ie. on the PSX, the intensity increases steeply from 0 to 15, and less steeply
from 16 to 31.<br>

  GPU Texture Caching
</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
The GPU has 2 Kbyte Texture Cache<br>
The Texture Cache is (maybe) also used for CLUT data - or is there a separate
CLUT Cache - or is the CLUT uncached - but that'd be trash?<br>
<br>
If polygons with texture are displayed, the GPU needs to read these from the
frame buffer. This slows down the drawing process, and as a result the number
of polygons that can be drawn in a given timespan. To speed up this process the
GPU is equipped with a texture cache, so a given piece of texture needs not to
be read multiple times in succession.<br>
The texture cache size depends on the color mode used for the textures.<br>
In 4 bit CLUT mode it has a size of 64x64, in 8 bit CLUT it's 32x64 and in
15bitDirect is 32x32. A general speed up can be achieved by setting up textures
according to these sizes. For further speed gain a more precise knowledge of
how the cache works is necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>Cache blocks</b><br>
The texture page is divided into non-overlapping cache blocks, each of a unit
size according to color mode. These cache blocks are tiled within the texture
page.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  +-----+-----+-----+--
  |cache|     |     |
  |block|     |
  |    0|   1 |    2   ..
  +-----+-----+--
  |..   |     |
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<b>Cache entries</b><br>
Each cache block is divided into 256 cache entries, which are numbered
sequentially, and are 8 bytes wide. So a cache entry holds 16 4bit clut pixels
8 8bit clut pixels, or 4 15bitdirect pixels.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  4bit and 8bit clut:        15bitdirect:

  |  ..                     |  ..
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
The cache can hold only one cache entry by the same number, so if f.e. a piece
of texture spans multiple cache blocks and it has data on entry 9 of block 1,
but also on entry 9 of block 2, these cannot be in the cache at once.<br>

<b>Perspective (in-)correct Rendering</b><br>
The PSX doesn't support perspective correct rendering: Assume a polygon to be
rotated so that it's right half becomes more distant to the camera, and it's
left half becomes closer. Due to the GTE's perspective division, the right half
should appear smaller than the left half.<br>
The GPU supports only linear interpolations for rendering - that is correct
concerning the X and Y screen coordinates (which are still linear to each
other, even after perspective division, since both are divided by the same
value).<br>
However, texture coordinates (and Gouraud shaded colors) are NOT linear to the
screen coordinates, and so, the linear interpolated PSX graphics are often
looking rather distorted, that especially for textures that contain straight
lines. For color shading the problem is less obvious (since shading is kinda
blurry anyways).<br>
<br>
<b>Perspective correct Rendering</b><br>
For perspective correct rendering, the polygon's Z-coordinates would be needed
to be passed from the GTE to the GPU, and, the GPU would then need to use that
Z-coordinates to "undo" the perspective division for each pixel (that'd require
some additional memory, and especially a powerful division unit, which isn't
implemented in the hardware).<br>
As a workaround, you can try to reduce the size of your polygons (the
interpolation errors increase in the center region of larger polygons).
Reducing the size would be only required for polygons that occupy a larger
screen region (which may vary depending on the distance to the camera).<br>
Ie. you may check the size AFTER perspective division, if it's too large, then
break it into smaller parts (using the original coordinates, NOT the screen
coordinates), and then pass the fragments to the GTE another time.<br>
Again, perspective correction would be relevant only for certain textures (not
for randomly dithered textures like sand, water, fire, grass, and not for
untextured polygons, and of course not for 2D graphics, so you may exclude
those from size reduction).<br>
<br>
<b>24bit RGB to 15bit RGB Dithering (enabled in Texpage attribute)</b><br>
For dithering, VRAM is broken to 4x4 pixel blocks, depending on the location in
that 4x4 pixel region, the corresponding dither offset is added to the 8bit
R/G/B values, the result is saturated to +00h..+FFh, and then divided by 8,
resulting in the final 5bit R/G/B values.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  -4  +0  -3  +1   ;\dither offsets for first two scanlines
  +2  -2  +3  -1   ;/
  -3  +1  -4  +0   ;\dither offsets for next two scanlines
  +3  -1  +2  -2   ;/(same as above, but shifted two pixels horizontally)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
POLYGONs (triangles/quads) are dithered ONLY if they do use gouraud shading or
texture blending.<br>
LINEs are dithered (no matter if they are mono or do use gouraud shading).<br>
RECTs are NOT dithered (no matter if they do use texture blending).<br>
<br>
<b>Shading information</b><br>
"Texture RGB values control the brightness of the individual colors ($00-$7f).
A value of $80 in a color will take the former value as data." (What...?
probably means the "double brightness" effect... or does it want to tell that
ALL colors of 80h..FFh have only single brightness.. rather than reaching
double brightness at FFh...?)<br>
<br>
<b>Shading</b><br>
The GPU has a shading function, which will scale the color of a primitive to a
specified brightness. There are 2 shading modes: Flat shading, and gouraud
shading. Flat shading is the mode in which one brightness value is specified
for the entire primitive. In Gouraud shading mode, a different brightness value
can be given for each vertex of a primitive, and the brightness between these
points is automatically interpolated.<br>
<br>
<b>Semi Transparency</b><br>
When semi transparency is set for a pixel, the GPU first reads the pixel it
wants to write to, and then calculates the color it will write from the 2
pixels according to the semitransparency mode selected. Processing speed is
lower in this mode because additional reading and calculating are necessary.
There are 4 semitransparency modes in the GPU.<br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  B=Back  (the old pixel read from the image in the frame buffer)

<b>Draw to display enable</b><br>
This will enable/disable any drawing to the area that is currently displayed.
Not sure yet WHY one should want to disable that?<br>
Also not sure HOW and IF it works... the SIZE of the display area is implied by
the screen size - which is horizontally counted in CLOCK CYCLES, so, to obtain
the size in PIXELS, the hardware would require to divide that value by the
number of cycles per pixel, depending on the current resolution...?<br>
